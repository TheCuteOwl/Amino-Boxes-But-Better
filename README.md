ADDING DOCUMENTATION LATER

## Amino-Box Alternative

* This repository was created for those who struggle with or dislike using Amino-Boxes from zeviel. Our goal is to provide a better working and visually appealing alternative.

## Introduction
* As you may already know, Amino-Boxes from zeviel can be challenging to work with, especially for those who are new to using them. Additionally, some may find the design of the Amino-Boxes to be unappealing. We've created an alternative that is easy to use and looks great.
